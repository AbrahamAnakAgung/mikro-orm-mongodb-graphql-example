# MIKRO-ORM MONGODB GRAPHQL EXAMPLE

This is a example code using [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io) instead of TypeORM.
because I want to use MongoDB as my database.

[MikroORM Github Repo](https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm)

I still learn how to use it and this is just an example and prototype for my next social media project.

## TODO:

[] create a resolver for Wheezper
